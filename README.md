# Hospital-Inventory-Management-System
 

## Problem Statement: 

To create a web application for managing covid-19 related inventory. Challenges faced by doctors are: 

When doctors are working day and night to cure Covid -19 positive patients it may happen that due to negligence or less availability of time that they will have more patients and less equipment. This may lead to a situation where some of the corona positive patients will be skipped and which eventually may lead catastrophic effect on the entire country. In order to overcome this challenge this application will give on time reminders to doctors to maintain proper amount of equipment and resources. 

When the corona positive patients are increasing at very fast rate it is really tough for corona warriors to find place where they can be treated this app will in turn help them to find the appropriate hospital 

**Solution**: 

The application will help corona warriors as well as hospital staff. The application will give insight about the resources  which include doctors, nurses as well as Covid -19 related equipment like testing kits, PPE kits and ventilators currently present in the hospital which will eventually help the corona warriors to choose the appropriate hospital admit corona positive people. This application will also help the hospital staff like doctors and nurses by giving them an interface to view, manage and keep a check on covid-19 related inventory so that they can order it well before time and ensure that the process of curing corona positive people does not stop. 

**Advantages**: 

* This Hospital Inventory Management Application will help the hospitals in maintaining surplus amount of equipment’s needed for treatment of Coronavirus infected patient. 

* While hospital staffs are busy with the surge of patients in the hospital this application will keep track of quantity of equipment’s and essential medicines and will raise appropriate alarm if at any point quantity of any equipment gets below the threshold limit. 

* And then just by a single click requirement alert/order will be sent to the respective NGOs /authorities. With this hospital can focus solely on patients without worrying about equipment availability 

* Unlike other inventory management application this is focused solely for fight against Coronavirus disease hence is more target specific.
